## Set Up Environment

Python **3** is required. Please make sure you have ```pip``` installed so that you can install all of the relevant packages for this repo. 
**Note:** I prefer to use Python 3.12, but Python3+ should suffice. Please try Python 3.12 first.

### Create & Activate Virtual Environment

We recommend that you create a clean new virtual environment to prevent any conflicts

#### Mac

Open terminal and run the following set of commands:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv

# specify version (I prefer to work with Python 3.12)
python3.12 -m venv venv
```

Activate the environment

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### Windows
Open the Command Prompt and run the following set of commands:

```bash
python -m venv .venv

# specify version (I prefer to work with Python 3.12)
py -3.12 -m venv .venv
```

```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

### Install Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You should now have a virtual environment that will let you run all of the code in `submission.ipynb`.
